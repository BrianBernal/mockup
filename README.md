# Description

With this mock I get my first Job as React Developer so this it has as many bugs as it is special ‚ù§Ô∏è

It was made only with react, react-router, a lots of prop drilling, [boostwatch](https://bootswatch.com/flatly), [react-modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal), and my icons are just emojis. üòÖ

See it deployed: https://mockup-brian.netlify.com/home

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
